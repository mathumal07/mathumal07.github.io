            From my young age itself there are many people who inspired me the most ,in variety of field.<br><br><br>
            <h2>CRISTIANO RONALDO</h2>
            Always my inspiration ;rolemodel ; was portugals football <br>
            player Cristiano Ronaldo.From i saw him play football ,i <br>
            was a huge fan of him.If i want to be like somebody in future<br> 
            its Cristiano Ronaldo.Apart from the childhood he has had ,<br>
            his true determination ,dedication ,and hardwork has led hime <br>
            to be the best footballer in the world.Now also at the age of <br>
            35 ,he dosent stop inspiring people with the ball.His action <br>
            truly says that we have to have some struggle to reach our goal <br>
            ,But never stop working for it.<br><br><br>
